In this README file I will link each project that I finish. Projects that share some common properties

<h2>Number</h2>
1. <a href="https://github.com/liemvo/learnpython3/blob/master/Numbers/pi.py"><strong>Find PI to the Nth Digit</strong></a> - Enter a number and have the program generate π (pi) up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go </br>
2. <a href="https://github.com/liemvo/learnpython3/blob/master/Numbers/e.py"><strong>Find e to the Nth Digit</strong></a> - Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of π (pi). Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.
3. <a href="https://github.com/liemvo/learnpython3/blob/master/Numbers/fibonacci.py"><strong>Fibonacci Sequence</strong></a> - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.
4. <a href="https://github.com/liemvo/learnpython3/blob/master/Numbers/prime.py"><strong>Prime Factorization</strong></a> - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.
